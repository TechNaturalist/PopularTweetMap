# Flask

The web application for this project will be a Flask Python application. For more information, see the [documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/). The [Visual Studio Code Flask tutuorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-flask) is also a good resource.

## Creating a virtual environment

[Python virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) isolate packages installed for specific purposes. This isn't required.
