85	1417165571855032343	@GeekBomb @amxndareviews Dune is by Frank Herbert. He's one of the legends of classic sci-fi literature! Currently, book two is the top best-seller in my sci-fi category on Amazon. Cool it's gonna be a movie!	41	-111	Dune	0.0	0.829	0.171	0.658

95	1416119560009224192	@mmasnick I was going to get Dune on Audible. But I'm not a big fantasy guy. I like thrillers, historical, historical fiction, or real life-like drama/fiction, crime stuff. But some fantasy/sci-fi has worked (usually YA, like Matched or Ready Player One). With all that: should I do Dune?	41	-111	Dune	0.087	0.714	0.199	0.631
