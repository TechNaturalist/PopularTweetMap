366	@DanWolken Texas will go to the Pac-12 if they blow up the Big 12. Oklahoma is a slam dunk to go SEC along with the Stillwater cowpokes.

386	@joewheat27 Most likely scenario in the event of that double defection; OU to SEC &amp; UT to Pac-12 would be Oklahoma State &amp; Texas Tech would be their tag-one‚Äôs. I could easily see the B1G coming in &amp; taking Iowa State &amp; Kansas (both being @AAUniversities affiliated).

396	@TheJazzyUte If there's no way to break into Texas Metro-Plex and/or Houston, stay at 12. If you can get Texas, go ahead and grab KC as well. Breaking into Central TZ gives some options for earlier kicks as well. But I'm not sure it makes sense for just Lubbock/OKC.
